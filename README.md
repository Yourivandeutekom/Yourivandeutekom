Hi, i'm Youri van Deutekom.

Since 2012 I started to build websites with Wordpress. As a rookie I started to edit PHP files which shouldn't be edited. I was hungry to code websites from scratch but instead I started filling in Wordpress websites with some basic HTML and CSS. 

Since 2021 my hunger came back and I started a course as a Full Stack developer. Got some certificated in HTML, CSS, PHP & MySQL and finished a course in JavaScript. Since then i'm very interested in this amazing field and I want to build my knowledge from here.

Since this year I found CodeCademy and started the Full Stack Course.

As a part of the CodeCademy Full Stack Course i'm taking a course on the foundations of web development. Where HTML and CSS are the key. My goal is to learn more about FlexBox and Grid and start to build 'basic' websites more often just for practise and build my portfolio. The web development foundations course is a top of the iceberg I want to learn this year. I want to extend my knowledge about JavaScript and build more applications and start to learn a new framework: Reactjs. 

My next goal(s) i would like to achieve:
 -  Portfolio website
 -  Starting the JavaScript course. 
 -  Learn a framework (reactjs)

Follow my progression!
