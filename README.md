Hi, i'm Youri van Deutekom.

I started making Wordpress websites since the start of my study interaction design back in 2012. Learned myself the very basics in HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL.
Since a few years i'm more interested in the arts of handcraft programming (websites?) started a study and now i'm exploring the beautifull world of Full stack development.

Currently i'm retaking a course on HTML and CSS. Just to read about things what i could have missed. This year i want to dive deeper in to the world,
JavaScript, maybe some libraries, apps, working on back ends. Lots to learn, but i'm very excited to do so!

My next goal(s) i would like to achieve in a month (06-08):
 -  Handcraft Portfolio website in HTML & CSS.
 -  'recoding' 5 local restaurant websites in HTML & CSS.
 -  Starting a JavaScript. 

I will use the portfolio and local restaurant websites to apply my new knowledge to.

The big goal?
  - Full Stack Developer

Currently i'm not open on collaborates, you can reach me in the future on my portfolio.
